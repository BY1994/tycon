# Typing Test + Console
Node.js console typing test

# NPM

[npmjs.com/package/tycon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clpsm)    

# Platform
Haven't tried it on MacOS, but any Linux terminal is fine. Windows is never going to like the frequency of console clear / writes, so unless there's some great GPU accelerated terminal it runs well on, I would recommend it.   

# Run

```bash
$ sudo npm i tycon -g   # Install
$ tycon easy            # Weak sauce
$ tycon med             # Groove time
$ tycon hard            # Wtf are these words
```  

# Shortcuts

```bash
$ ^R                    # Start / Restart
$ ^C                    # Quit
```
