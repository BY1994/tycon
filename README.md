# Typing Test + Console
Node.js console typing test. Easy, Med, & Hard Difficulties, Speed graph, Shortcuts   
[npmjs.com/package/tycon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tycon)    

# Platforms
Written in and runs great on Linux. Haven't tried yet on MacOS, but should be similar.  Windows is never going to like the frequency of console clear / writes, so unless there's some great GPU accelerated terminal it runs well on, I wouldn't recommend it.   

# Run

```bash
$ sudo npm i tycon -g   # Install
$ tycon easy            # Weak sauce for 60 seconds
$ tycon med             # Groove time
$ tycon hard            # Wtf are these words
$ tycon 10            	# Medium for 10 seconds
$ tycon easy 300
```  

## Shortcuts

```bash
$ ^R                    # Start / Restart
$ ^C                    # Quit
```
